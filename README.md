# ReSQ

Recovering from a disaster requires a lot of money. Besides governments' efforts, it is our duty to help our fellow humans(and other beings) who are struck with a disaster. That's how we feel right? So we tend to donate clothes, food, money to NGO's directly or through crowdsourcing platforms. It's a divine thing to do. Great! But are you really sure that your donating are REALLY reaching the needy?

In the REAL WORLD, there are scavengers who feed off war and disaster. It's aweful. I am not being a pessimist here but REAL. There is a great need for transparency in the field of crowdsourcing. There is need to know how legit are these NGOs or relief organisations and what is happening to the fund crowdsourced(money management).

## Idea

The plan is to create a decentralised platform for crowdsourcing. The crowdsourcing requestors will be validated on putting forth PROOFS. Then they will be allowed to create a crowdsourcing pool. On successful pooling, the requestors will be allowed to withdraw on demand. They should be showing the need for the withdrawing fund and how the fund was used. All this will be stored on a blockchain. So there is no alternations.

So I will be creating a web app using nodejs and use [OST](https://ost.com/) because it allows for scaling Ethereum for billions of users.
